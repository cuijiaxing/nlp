You must have unzipped stanford-corenlp-full-2013-11-12 version in the same folder as the repl file (this is version 3.3.0, not the latest version).
To run the program type:

python -i repl.py

#... wait a bit for corenlp to laod ...
>>readA('articlename.txt')
>>askQ('What is blah blah blah?')
>>r = getrank()
>>r[0:5] # returns the top 5 sentence matches
